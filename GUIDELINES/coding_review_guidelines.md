# Coding Review Guidelines

## Overview

Code review plays a pivotal role in our development process, guaranteeing the quality, maintainability, and collaborative excellence of our codebase. The guidelines presented here are evolving, offering a structured approach to code reviews and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing within our development team.

### 1. Be Kind
Maintaining a positive and respectful tone in feedback is essential. Acknowledge the submitter's efforts, fostering a constructive and collaborative atmosphere that emphasizes improvement over criticism.

### 2. Prompt Initiation of Code Reviews
Try to initiate code reviews promptly, ideally on the same day or the next, to prevent bottlenecks and facilitate quicker iteration on code changes.

### 3. Consistent Coding Standards:
Enforce adherence to [coding standards and style guidelines]((https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/GUIDELINES/coding_guidelines.md). [Automated tools](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/CI/README.md#what-checks-are-run) are leveraged to catch common issues related to coding standards.

### 4. Clarity and Readability:
Ensure that the code is clear and concise. Prioritize readability to enhance understanding and maintainability.

### 5. Code Examples
Provide comprehensive and illustrative snippets to support feedback and recommendations. When offering guidance or suggesting improvements, aim to go beyond mere textual explanations. Instead, supplement your comments with tangible code examples that vividly showcase the recommended practices, design patterns, or alternative approaches.

### 6. Make it manageable
Look for opportunities to split up large reviews to achieve focused and efficient assessments, reduced cognitive load, quicker turnaround, improved collaboration, easier debugging, enhanced code quality, and iterative progress.

### 7. Navigating Stalemates
Effectively navigate stalemates in code reviews through timely identification of the same, open communication, seeking common ground, involving additional perspectives, defining actionable steps, establishing a decision-making process, and documenting agreements in the [coding guidelines]((https://github.com/ansible-collections/cloud-content-handbook/blob/main/GUIDELINES/coding_guidelines.md). 

### 8. Collaboration and Communication:
Foster a positive and collaborative atmosphere during code reviews. Provide constructive feedback that promotes improvement and encourages knowledge sharing within the team.

### 9. Continuous Learning:
Encourage ongoing learning and knowledge sharing. Use code reviews as opportunities for mentoring and skill development.

### 10. Guided Feedback
Ensure feedback in code reviews is tethered to coding guidelines rather than individual opinions. Promote objectivity and consistency in the evaluation process.
