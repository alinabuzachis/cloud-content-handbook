# Collections Overview

These are the collections that generally fall under the Cloud Content team's purview. We maintain/contribute to three types of collections: supported collections, community collections, and [validated content](validated.md).

See the [collections release tracker](https://cloud-releases.jillr.dev/) for an overview of the current collection releases.

\* While redhat.openshift is the supported collection for OpenShift, it is auto-generated from community.okd. As such, when changes are needed to the redhat.openshift collection they are first made in the community.okd repository and from that redhat.openshift is generated and uploaded to Ansible Automation Hub.
